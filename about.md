I've made airplanes fly, designed organizational structures, and delivered complex projects impacting millions.
Throughout my career I sought out the most complex problems in the most challenging spaces and developed a reputation as 
a fixer and someone who gets stuff done. As I move to the next phase of my life, I look to use my experience to coach,
mentor and grow those around me creaIng amazing people in the process, capable of overcoming any challenges they face.
