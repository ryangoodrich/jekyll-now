title: Setting up a Serverless Application
---

Recently I was bitten by the _Serverless_ bug. Around the same time, we were 
starting [PointX Solutions](pointxsolutions.com), and I decided it would be a
great idea to write the PointX platform with the goal of not managing any
servers. Sounds like a great idea right??

Phase 1: Platform Choice

There are currently three major players in the
serverless space: Amazon (AWS), Google (Google Cloud), and Microsoft (Azure).


Phase 2: Deployment Automation


Phase 3: Integrating TypeScript


Phase 4: Building Tests
